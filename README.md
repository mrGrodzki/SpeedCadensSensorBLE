# SpeedCadensSensorBLE

A device for measuring and sending through the BLE the speed of the cyclist and the speed of rotation of the pedals. created on the basis of a module that has a nrf52840 microcontroller. The device also sends its data in a standardized form, so any application can receive this data
The next version will be based on the EFR32BG22 microcontroller with ble. and gyroscope/accelerometer and main sensor.
